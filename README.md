##  Project Overview

This is a complete end-to-end **SQL project** built on an **Online Food Delivery** dataset.  
The project covers database design, data insertion, business analysis, performance optimization using indexes, and automation using triggers — across **9 structured phases**.

---

##  Business Objectives

- Analyze customer ordering behavior and spending patterns
- Identify top-performing restaurants and cuisine types
- Monitor delivery performance across cities and agents
- Detect high-value orders and delivery delays automatically
- Optimize query performance using indexing
- Automate data integrity checks using triggers

---

##  Dataset Overview

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `customers` | Customer details — name, city, registration date |
| `restaurants` | Restaurant info — cuisine type, city, rating |
| `menu_items` | Menu items with price and availability |
| `delivery_agents` | Agent details — vehicle type, city |
| `orders` | Core transaction table — amount, date, delivery time |
| `order_items` | Line items per order |

---

##  Project Phases

###  Phase 1 — Database & Table Setup
- Created normalized database schema
- Defined primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
- 6 tables: `customers`, `restaurants`, `menu_items`, `delivery_agents`, `orders`, `order_items`

###  Phase 2 — Data Insertion
- Inserted realistic sample data
- 10 customers, 10 restaurants, 5 delivery agents, 15+ orders

###  Phase 3 — Basic Data Exploration
- Total orders, total revenue, average order value
- Orders grouped by payment method

###  Phase 4 — Customer Analysis
- Top 5 customers by spending
- Customer frequency classification (Frequent / Regular / Occasional)
- City-wise customer distribution

###  Phase 5 — Restaurant & Revenue Analysis
- Top 10 restaurants by revenue
- Revenue breakdown by cuisine type
- City-wise orders and revenue

###  Phase 6 — Delivery Performance Analysis
- Average, fastest, and slowest delivery times by city
- Delivery agent performance ranking
- Orders with delivery time > 45 minutes (delayed)

### Phase 7 — Advanced Queries & Business Insights
- Monthly revenue trend analysis
- High-value orders (above ₹1000)
- Discount impact analysis
- Repeat customer identification
- Best performing day of the week

###  Phase 8 — Performance Optimization (Indexes)
- Created indexes on `order_date`, `customer_name`, `restaurant_name`, `city`, `order_amount`
- Used `EXPLAIN` to verify query optimization
- Primary key columns skipped (auto-indexed)

### Phase 9 — Triggers (Automation)
- **Trigger 1:** Auto-logs orders with amount > ₹1000 into `high_value_orders_log`
- **Trigger 2:** Prevents negative discount values on insert (sets to 0)
- **Trigger 3:** Auto-logs orders with delivery time > 45 mins into `delivery_delay_log`

##  Dashboard Queries

Exported query results used to build charts in Google Sheets:

| Chart | Type |
|---|---|
| Total Revenue | Scorecard |
| City-wise Total Orders | Pie Chart |
| Top 10 Restaurants by Revenue | Bar Chart |
| City-wise Average Delivery Time | 3D Pie Chart |
| Monthly Revenue Trend | Line Chart |
| Payment Method Distribution | Donut Chart |

---

##  Performance Optimization

```sql
-- Indexes created for faster query execution
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date      ON orders(order_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_name   ON customers(customer_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_restaurant_name ON restaurants(restaurant_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_city     ON orders(city);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_amount    ON orders(order_amount);
```

---

##  Triggers

```sql
-- Trigger 1: Log high value orders
CREATE TRIGGER trg_high_value_orders
AFTER INSERT ON orders FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.order_amount > 1000 THEN
        INSERT INTO high_value_orders_log ...
    END IF;
END;

-- Trigger 2: Prevent negative discounts
CREATE TRIGGER trg_prevent_negative_discount
BEFORE INSERT ON orders FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.discount < 0 THEN SET NEW.discount = 0; END IF;
END;

-- Trigger 3: Log delayed deliveries
CREATE TRIGGER trg_delivery_delay_warning
AFTER INSERT ON orders FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.delivery_time_minutes > 45 THEN
        INSERT INTO delivery_delay_log ...
    END IF;
END;
```
